# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the *Knit* button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure, xlab = "temp", ylab = "press", col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2, type = "l")
lines(sqrt(pressure), col = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 2, type = "l")
legend("topright", c("pressure", "sqrt(pressure)"), col = c("red", "blue"), lwd = 2, lty = c(2,1))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
